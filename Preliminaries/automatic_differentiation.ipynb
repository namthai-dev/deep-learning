    "Derivatives is the crucial step in all of the optimization algorithms that we will use to train deep networks. While the calculations are straightforward, working them out by hand can be tedious and error-prone, and this problem only grows as our models become more complex.\n",

    "Fortunately all modern deep learning frameworks take this work off of our plates by offering automatic differentiation (often shortened to autograd). As we pass data through each successive function, the framework builds a computational graph that tracks how each value depends on others. To calculate derivatives, automatic differentiation works backwards through this graph applying the chain rule. The computational algorithm for applying the chain rule in this fashion is called backpropagation."

    "Sometimes, we wish to move some calculations outside of the recorded computational graph. For example, say that we use the input to create some auxiliary intermediate terms for which we do not want to compute a gradient. In this case, we need to detach the respective computational graph from the final result. The following toy example makes this clearer: suppose we have z = x * y and y = x * x but we want to focus on the direct influence of x on z rather than the influence conveyed via y. In this case, we can create a new variable u that takes the same value as y but whose provenance (how it was created) has been wiped out. Thus u has no ancestors in the graph and gradients do not flow through u to x. For example, taking the gradient of z = x * u will yield the result x, (not 3 * x * x as you might have expected since z = x * x * x)."

    "So far we reviewed cases where the path from input to output was well-defined via a function such as z = x * x * x. Programming offers us a lot more freedom in how we compute results. For instance, we can make them depend on auxiliary variables or condition choices on intermediate results. One benefit of using automatic differentiation is that even if building the computational graph of a function required passing through a maze of Python control flow (e.g., conditionals, loops, and arbitrary function calls), we can still calculate the gradient of the resulting variable. To illustrate this, consider the following code snippet where the number of iterations of the while loop and the evaluation of the if statement both depend on the value of the input a."

The development of libraries for calculating derivatives both automatically and efficiently has been a massive productivity booster for deep learning practitioners, liberating them to focus on loftier concerns. Moreover, autograd permits us to design massive models for which pen and paper gradient computations would be prohibitively time consuming. Interestingly, while we use autograd to optimize models (in a statistical sense) the optimization of autograd libraries themselves (in a computational sense) is a rich subject of vital interest to framework designers. Here, tools from compilers and graph manipulation are leveraged to compute results in the most expedient and memory-efficient manner.\n",
